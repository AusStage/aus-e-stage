<h1>Access the ABS TableBuilder website</h1>

The TableBuilder website is the prefered method of exporting data from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](http://www.abs.gov.au) website as it is much faster, and provides a richer experience than the [CDATA Online](http://www.abs.gov.au/census) website.

Access to the TableBuilder website is restricted to those with a username and password. Users at Australian Universities are recommended to talk to their library in order to arrange access.

Other users can read about how to gain access at the [TableBuilder](http://www.abs.gov.au/TableBuilder) website.
