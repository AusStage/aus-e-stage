<wiki:comment> Keep this list in sync with the RdfExport page</wiki:comment>

To assist in the clarity of !AusStage unique identifiers in the dataset the following encoding scheme is used:

 * A unique identifier is prefixed with _ausstage:_
 * If the unique identifier is for a contributor _c:_ is then added
 * If the unique identifier is for an event _e:_ is then added

The [http://code.google.com/p/aus-e-stage/source/browse/trunk/rdf-export/src/au/edu/ausstage/vocabularies/AusStageURI.java AusStageURI class] in the au.edu.ausstage.vocabularies package provides convenience methods for encoding identifiers, and converting identifiers into the persistent URLs used by the !AusStage website
