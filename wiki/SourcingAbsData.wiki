#summary Sourcing Census Data from the ABS

<h1>Sourcing Census Data</h1>

One of the many and varied goals of the Mapping Service is to develop a series overlays. These overlays will be used to add information to a map to assist users in gaining the most insight from the !AusStage data.

One of the first sets overlays that were developing are derived from data obtained from the [http://www.abs.gov.au/ Australian Bureau of Statistics] and in particular the [http://www.abs.gov.au/census 2006 Census].

The purpose of this page is to outline the procedure for collecting data for use with the AbsDataFix application and the construction of overlays.

It is recommended that you print this page or open the link to the ABS in a new window. 

_Note: Only those datasets that the AbsDataFix application has been configured to work with can be turned into overlays_
