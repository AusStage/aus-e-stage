#summary Overview of the Components of the Navigating Networks service

<h1>Navigating Networks Service Component Overview</h1>

The [NetworkService Navigating Networks Service] is made up of a number of different components that combined provide the functionality required by the [NavigatingNetworksSpecification Navigating Networks Specification]. 

The purpose of this Wiki page is to provide an overview of the components and the functionality that they provide.

The structure of the NetworkService is loosely based on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller MVC] approach to system design. When viewed from this perspective the Java Server Pages (in green) are the views, the various classes (in dark blue) are controllers, and the Java Servlets (in turquoise) are the controllers.
