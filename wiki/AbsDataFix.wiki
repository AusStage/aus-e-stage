#summary How to build overlays using ABS Data

<h1>!AbsDataFix - Building Map Overlays using ABS Data</h1>

The AbsDataFix application has been designed to provide a flexible framework for the manipulation of data sourced from the [http://www.abs.gov.au Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)] on the 2006 census. 

The data is manipulated in a variety of different ways to build overlays for use with [http://earth.google.com Google Earth] and other GIS enabled systems. Datasets are also constructed so that the [http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/mapping/ AusStage Mapping Service] can be used to dynamically populate the infoWindows in each overlay.

Outlined below are the steps necessary to use the AbsDataFix application to prepare a dataset sourced from the ABS using the SourcingAbsData procedure.
