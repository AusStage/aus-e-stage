#summary Information About the Exchange Data Service

<h1>Data Exchange Service</h1>

The ExchangeDataService is designed to allow users to retrieve in real time data from the [http://www.ausstage.edu.au AusStage] database. The data can be retrieved in the following formats:

 # html - as an unordered list
 # json - data formatted as a series of objects encoded using the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON JSON] syntax
 # xml  - as a series of elements in an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML XML] file
 # rss  - as a standard [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS RSS] feed

An optional parameter can also be used which will cause the data to be wrapped in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript JavaScript] function to make it easier to integrate with existing websites.
