#summary Information on the syntax of direct links for maps

<h1>Syntax for Direct Map Links</h1>

A direct link for a map is a link that when used by a user automatically constructs a map and populates it with data. There are two different types of direct links:

 # Simple Map Links - where only one record type and unique identifier are used
 # Complex Map Links - where a total of up 100 unique identifiers for all of the record types can be used

The simple syntax is used by the [http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/?tab=extras&section=bookmarklet Map Bookmarklet] to provide an easy way to navigate from a record in !AusStage to the Mapping Service. 

The complex syntax us used to provide the map bookmark functionality.
