= About SPARQL =

SPARQL Query Language for RDF is a language that can be used to query RDF data sources. The [NetworkService Navigating Networks Service] uses an RDF based datastore that is created and populated by the RdfExport application. 

== Useful Links ==

Useful SPARQL Links include:

 * [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/ SPARQL Query Language for RDF Specification]
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL Wikipedia page on SPARQL]
 * [http://jena.sourceforge.net/ARQ/Tutorial/ Jena SPARQL Tutorial] - Jena is the library used to manage this datastore

== Notes == 

It can be useful when developing queries, especially early in the development process, to use the `LIMIT` clause to limit the number of records returned. This clause is placed after the last `}` of the `WHERE` clause and looks like this:

{{{LIMIT 10}}}

Where the number, in this case 10, specifies the number of records to return. 

= Sample Queries = 

Below are a list of sample queries that can be used with the NavigatingNetworksSparqlEndpoint.

== List the Collaborators of a Contributor == 

{{{
PREFIX foaf:       <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
PREFIX ausestage:  <http://code.google.com/p/aus-e-stage/wiki/AuseStageOntology#>
 
SELECT ?collaborator ?collabGivenName ?collabFamilyName
WHERE {  
       <REPLACE_ME>   a foaf:Person ; 
                      ausestage:hasCollaboration ?collaboration. 
       ?collaboration ausestage:collaborator ?collaborator.
       ?collaborator  foaf:givenName ?collabGivenName;
                      foaf:familyName ?collabFamilyName.
       FILTER (?collaborator != <REPLACE_ME>) 
}
}}}

_Note:_ Replace the `REPLACE_ME` with the unique identifier of a contributor encoded using the [http://code.google.com/p/aus-e-stage/wiki/RdfExportMoreInfo#AusStage_Unique_Id_Encoding_Scheme AusStage Unique Id Encoding Scheme]. 

For example to find all of the collaborators for [http://www.ausstage.edu.au/indexdrilldown.jsp?xcid=59&f_contrib_id=774 Robyn Archer] the query looks like this:

{{{
PREFIX foaf:       <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
PREFIX ausestage:  <http://code.google.com/p/aus-e-stage/wiki/AuseStageOntology#>
 
SELECT ?collaborator ?collabGivenName ?collabFamilyName
WHERE {  
       <ausstage:c:774> a foaf:Person ; 
                      ausestage:hasCollaboration ?collaboration. 
       ?collaboration ausestage:collaborator ?collaborator.
       ?collaborator  foaf:givenName ?collabGivenName;
                      foaf:familyName ?collabFamilyName.
       FILTER (?collaborator != <ausstage:c:774>) 
}
}}}
