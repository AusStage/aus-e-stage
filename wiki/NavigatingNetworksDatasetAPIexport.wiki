<h1> Export API </h1>

The export API provides the functionality to export data out of the [NavigatingNetworksDataset Navigating Networks Dataset] in a variety of different formats.

The details of the API are as follows:

= Parameter Definitions =

== Task: simple-network-directed ==

A basic directed ego-centric network starting with the contributor with the supplied id. 

== Task: simple-network-undirected ==

A basic un-directed ego-centric network starting with the contributor with the supplied id. 

== Format: graphml ==

This export format uses the [http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html GraphML] data format and includes edges and nodes.

== Format: debug ==

This export format provides a text based representation of the internal data structures used by the service while compiling the graph. The format is as follows:

id - list of collaborators - number of collaborators in the list

For example:

111 - 101, 102, 1324, 56789 - 4

== Degrees ==

The degrees of separation to follow from the central node as defined by the supplied id parameter.
