#summary Mobile Service API - Search

<h1>Search API</h1>

Components of the MolileService are exposed as an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface API]. The intention of the API is to make it easier for developers to customise their own front end interfaces and to split the work equitably amongst the software engineers working on the Aus-e-Stage project. 

The Search API exposes methods and data elements that can be used to search for contributors, organisations, etc. 

_Note 1: During development of the service revisions the API will use a temporary URL which will be changed once the service revisions are complete._

_Note 2: The search interface provided by the mapping service is designed to be supplementary to the existing text based search interface. Once the new !AusStage website is in place this API is expected to be deprecated as the mapping service will be integrated with the new !AusStage website._
