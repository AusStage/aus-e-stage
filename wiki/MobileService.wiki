#summary Information about the Mobile Service

= Mobile Service =

The mobile service will be used to solicit feedback in real time from audience members who are attending, or have just attended, a performance. 

The feedback will be solicited using a combination of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS SMS] and [http://twitter.com Twitter] and will be analysed using a variety of qualitative techniques. 

More information about the service will be posted here and to the [http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/ Aus-e-Stage project website] as development progresses.
