#summary AusStage Exchange Analytics

<h1> !AusStage Exchange Analytics </h1>

The !AusStage Exchange Analytics app parses the log files created by the [http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/exchange/ Data Exchange] service to create a report that provides an overview of the usage of the service. 

This report is available via the Aus-e-Stage website under the "Analytics Tab". A [http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/?tab=analytics&section=exchange direct link] is also available. 

The report contains the following sections:

 # Requests for the current month
 # Requests for the previous month
 # Requests for the year
 # Requests by record type
 # Requests for event data by request type
 # Requests for resource data by request type
 # Requests for event data by output type
 # Requests for resource data by output type
 # Requests for feedback data by output type

The report is updated automatically every Monday morning, and can be run manually at other times.
