#summary AusStage Website Analytics

= AusStage Website Analytics =

The AusStage Website Analytics app automatically queries the [http://www.google.com/analytics Google Analytics] service and creates reports that are displayed on the main [http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/ Aus-e-Stage project website] under the "Analytics" tab. 

These reports can contain up to four different sections:

 # Visits for the current month, by day
 # Visits for the previous month, by day
 # Visits for the current year, by month
 # Visits for the previous year, by month

Other metrics could be added to the reports by modifying the Web Site Analytics application.
