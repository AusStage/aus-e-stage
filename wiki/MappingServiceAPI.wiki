#summary Details of the Mapping Service API

<h1>Mapping Service API</h1>

The Mapping Service exposes an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface API] for the retrieval of data related to building a map on a web page and the export of data in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language KML] format.

Data exported in the KML format can be used with a wide variety of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system GIS] based applications including the popular [http://earth.google.com/ Google Earth] application. 

_Note: The Mapping Service is undergoing extensive revisions and as such only the updated API will be listed here as it is completed._

Details of the API are in the following pages:

 * [MappingServiceAPIMarkers Marker Data API] - retrieve data used to build markers
 * [MappingServiceAPISearch Search API] - search for organisations / contributors etc.
