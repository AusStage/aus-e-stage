#summary Using the RdfExport App to Create the Navigating Networks Dataset

<h1>Creating the Navigating Networks Dataset</h1>

The creation of the dataset for use by the Navigating Networks service is achieved using the !RdfExport application. This application, written in Java, creates an RDF based datastore that contains all data necessary to create network diagrams. 

More information about the application such as the tools and ontologies used, is available on the RdfExportMoreInfo page.

_Note:_ It is strongly advised to only run this application on a 64bit operating system.

The application undertakes the following tasks:

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Building the Dataset =

The current dataset contains the elements listed on the NavigatingNetworksDataset page. 

To build the dataset follow these steps:

 # Ensure the application is installed by [RdfExportMoreInfo#Installing_the_Application following these directions]
 # Ensure the application is configured by [RdfExportMoreInfo#Configuring_the_Application following these directions]
 # Change to the _jar_ directory created when the application was installed
 # Run the application using the following command where 
   # properties-file: is the location of the properties file created in step 2
   {{{java -Xmx2048m -Xms512m -jar AusStageRdfExport.jar -task build-network-data -properties properties-file}}}
 # The application will take some time to complete

= Exporting the Dataset =

The dataset can be exported into a variety of different serialised data formats and they are:

 * RDF/XML - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDF/XML
 * N-TRIPLE - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Triples
 * TURTLE - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)
 * N3 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation3

To export the entire dataset follow these steps:

 # Ensure the application is installed by [RdfExportMoreInfo#Installing_the_Application following these directions]
 # Ensure the application is configured by [RdfExportMoreInfo#Configuring_the_Application following these directions]
 # Ensure the dataset has been created by following the [RdfExport#Building_the_Dataset Building the Dataset] steps
 # Change to the _jar_ directory created when the application was installed
 # Run the application using the following command where 
   # properties-file: is the location of the properties file created in step 2
   # format-type: is one of the listed formats above
   # output-file: is the name of the output file to create (including path information)
   {{{java -Xmx1024m -Xms512m -jar AusStageRdfExport.jar -tasktype export-network-data -properties properties-file -format format-type -output output-file}}}
 # If no format is specified the default format 'RDF/XML' will be used
 # The application will take a short time to complete and the output will look like this:

= Querying the Dataset = 

Querying the dataset is possible using the SPARQL query language with ARQ specific extensions. 

_Note:_ This functionality is designed to assist in the development of queries for use in other applications / services and is not meant to provide a query and export workflow

To query the dataset follow these steps:

 # Ensure the application is installed by [RdfExportMoreInfo#Installing_the_Application following these directions]
 # Ensure the application is configured by [RdfExportMoreInfo#Configuring_the_Application following these directions]
 # Ensure the dataset has been created by following the [RdfExport#Building_the_Dataset Building the Dataset] steps
 # Change to the _jar_ directory created when the application was installed
 # Run the application using the following command where 
   # properties-file: is the location of the properties file created in step 2
   # query-file: is the location of a plain text file that defines the query (including path information)
   {{{java -Xmx1024m -Xms512m -jar AusStageRdfExport.jar -tasktype run-query -properties properties-file -query query-file}}}
 # The results of the query execution will be printed to the screen

= Exporting the Dataset as an Edge List File = 

The Edge List File is contains data in the following plain text format where each line contains the following

 * contributorid - the unique identifier of a contributor
 * givenName - the given name of the contributor
 * familyName - the family name of the contributor
 * tab - the tab character

<pre>
<contributorid><tab><givenName><tab><familyName><tab><contributorid><tab><givenName><tab><familyName>
</pre>

_Note:_ This export contains duplicate edges for example:

<pre>
<01><tab><James><tab><Bond><tab><02><tab><Money><tab><Penny>
<02><tab><Money><tab><Penny><tab><01><tab><James><tab><Bond>
</pre>

To produce a an list of edges without duplicates substitute _edge-list-export_ with _edge-list-export-no-dups_ in step 5 below.

This format can be used in a variety of graph based applications. 

To export the dataset in this format use the following steps:

 # Ensure the application is installed by [RdfExportMoreInfo#Installing_the_Application following these directions]
 # Ensure the application is configured by [RdfExportMoreInfo#Configuring_the_Application following these directions]
 # Ensure the dataset has been created by following the [RdfExport#Building_the_Dataset Building the Dataset] steps
 # Change to the _jar_ directory created when the application was installed
 # Run the application using the following command where 
   # properties-file: is the location of the properties file created in step 2
   # output-file: is the name of the output file to create (including path information)
   {{{java -Xmx1024m -Xms512m -jar AusStageRdfExport.jar -tasktype edge-list-export -properties properties-file -output output-file}}}
