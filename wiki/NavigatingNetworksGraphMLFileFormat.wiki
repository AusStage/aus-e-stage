#summary Investigations into the GraphML File Format support in Network Workbench, Visone and Gephi

== Introduction ==

GraphML can be used to define the topology of a graph by declaring its nodes and edges. In addition to this, application related information of simple type for the elements of the graph can be specified through the extension [http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html#Attributes GraphML-Attributes]. To look into the capability of the network analysis and visualization software (Network Workbench, Visone and Gephi) in regards to their support for GraphML format – attribute in particular, a simple actors’ network in GraphML format is prepared and examined in the software mentioned above.


== Actors’ Network in GraphML Format ==

To illustrate the GraphML with attribute support, a sample GraphML described a simple actors’ network with 3 nodes and 2 edges is prepared. Please refer to the following Figure.

In this actors’ network, actors are defined as nodes.  The contributor ID is defined as node id. Each node has 3 attributes. They are *!FirstName*, *LastName* and *!Gender* respectively. Edge is defined from source node to target node. It represents the events two actors have worked on. Each edge has 2 attributes. They are *NumOfEvents* which represents edge weight and *DateRange*. The topology of the network is shown in the following Figure.

== GraphML support in Network Workbench, Visone and Gephi ==


To explore how GraphML format is supported in the network analysis and visualization softwares such as Network Workbench (GUESS is used as visualization tool), Visone and Gephi in particular, eight categories are identified to examine their GraphML support when the actors network file is opened in these three software. They are *Topology*, *NodeID*, *Edge source & target*, *Node attribute definition*, *Node attribute value*, *Edge attribute definition*, *Edge attribute value* and *GraphML export*. The first seven categories are related with input format and how the software explains attributes and their value when the GraphML file is opened in them. The following section will explain the eight categories and how the software supports it respectively. Table 1 shows the summary of the comparation.

*1)	Topology* is used to justify whether the software can display the graph (nodes and edges) correctly without considering attributes. 
      All the three software can display the graph properly. In another words, all the nodes and edges declared in the actors network can be recognized. 
_Note:_
      [http://guess.wikispot.org/GraphML GUESS] and [http://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/graphml-format/ Gephi] said on their website that it support a limited set of this format (no subgraphs or hyperedges).
      [http://visone.info/doku.php?id=docs:index Visone] said that its native file format  is GraphML.
