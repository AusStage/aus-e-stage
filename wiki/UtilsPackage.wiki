#summary All about the AusStage Utilities Package

=!AusStage Utilities Package=

The !AusStage Utilities Package contains classes that are useful in undertaking repetitive tasks and provides a number of utility based functions. 

_Note: Some applications / servlets may use their own independent implementations of these methods / classes as they were developed *before* the utilities package. Where this is the case work should be undertaken to replace the independent functionality with that available in this package._
