#summary Overview of the AusStage Tweet Gatherer Application

<h1>!AusStage Tweet Gatherer</h1>

_NOTE:_ This procedure document is deprecated due to a change in direction for the collection of feedback for the MobileService
----

The !AusStage Tweet Gatherer Application is designed to collect messages from [http://twitter.com Twitter] that are sent by audience participants either during, or immediately after a performance. The messages will be aggregated, and made part of the dataset used by the [MobileService Mobile Service].

The AusStage Tweet Gatherer application replaces the [TwitterGatherer Twitter Gatherer] application. This new application supports the [http://dev.twitter.com/pages/oauth_faq OAuth] protocol via an updated version of the [http://github.com/seejohnrun/tweetStream4J tweetStream4J] library which uses the [http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api Twitter Streaming API].

= Identifying Messages = 

The !AusStage Tweet Gatherer identifies messages intended as feedback on a performance in one of two ways:

 # Using company specific identifiers
  * Determining the date and time that the message was sent
  * Identifying performances that are occurring at that time or events that ended within two hours of the message being sent
  * Identifying the company mentioned in the message using a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tag#Hash_tags hash tag]
  * Matching the company specific hash tag to that listed with a performance
 # Using performance specific identifiers
   * Identifying the performance mentioned in the message using a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tag#Hash_tags hash tag]
  * Matching the company specific hash tag to that listed with a performance

If a performance can not be identified the message is stored and an exception report is generated. This report is sent via email to !AusStage personnel for manual action. 

= De-Identifying Information = 

It is a requirement of the project that all messages be de-identified. In this way it is possible to identify messages that have been sent by the same Twitter user, however it is not possible to identify specific individuals. 

In order to de-identify messages the following fields in a Twitter Message are removed:

|| *Field Name*      || *Description* ||
|| url               || the URL associated with the twitter users account, for example their website ||
|| profile_image_url || the URL to the twitter users profile image ||
|| screen_name       || the twitter users user name ||
|| profile_background_image_url || the url to the image used in the background of the users profile page ||
|| name              || the users name ||
|| description       || the description associated with the user ||

The following fields are obfuscated by means of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2 cryptographic hash]

|| *Field Name* || *Description* ||
|| id           || the unique identifier for the message ||
|| user_id      || the unique identifier for the user || 
|| in_reply_to_user_id || if this message is in reply to another user that users id is stored in this field ||
|| in_reply_to_status_id || if the message is in reply to another message the id of the original message is stored in this field || 
|| retweeted_status || if the message is a retweet the id of the original message is stored in this field || 

In this way relationships between messages, and the grouping of messages by user can be achieved without identifying any individual
