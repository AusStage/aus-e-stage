= Parameter Value Definitions =
The values of the parameters influences the way in which the API works, for example defining which records to use in constructing a dataset. These values are outlined below

== Type: organisation ==
Defines a request for marker data using organisation records

== Type:contributor ==
Defines a request for marker data using contributor records

== Type: orgname ==

Lookup the name of an organisation

== Type: orgname2 ==

Lookup the name of an organisation and only return the name if it has events that can be mapped

== Type: contribname ==

Lookup the name of a contributor

== Type: contribname2 ==

Lookup the name of a contributor and only return the name if it has events that can be mapped

== Operator: and ==

Undertake a search using the "and" operator. Meaning that _all_ of the terms in the search must be found.

== Operator: or ==

Undertake a search using the "or" operator. Meaning that _some_ of the terms in the search must be found.

== Operator: exact ==

Undertake a search using the exact phrase. Meaning that the name must match exactly, or that additional advanced search operators have been used

== Type: single ==

Format the search results to include user interface elements for adding a single contributor / organisation onto the map

== Type: multi ==

Format the search results to include user interface elements for adding multiple contributors / organisations onto the map
