#summary Mapping Service API - Event Lookup

<h1>Event API</h1>

Components of the MappingService are exposed as an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface API]. The intention of the API is to make it easier for developers to customise their own front end interfaces and to split the work equitably amongst the software engineers working on the Aus-e-Stage project. 

The Lookup API exposes methods that can be used to retrieve details of events that occurred at a venue for use in populating infoWindows in the maps.

_Note 1: During development of the service revisions the API will use a temporary URL which will be changed once the service revisions are complete._
