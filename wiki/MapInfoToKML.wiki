#summary Notes on the procedure to convert MapInfo files to KML

== Introduction ==

In order to display ABS statistical data in our mapping service, we need create map overlays in a KML format using ABS geographic information first. What we have is [http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1259.0.30.001July%202010?OpenDocument Local Government Area ASGC Ed 2010 Digital Boundaries in MapInfo Interchange Format and ESRI Shapefile Format] from the ABS website. To construct an ABS overlay which can be used in Google Earth, we need to convert a MapInfo or ESRI Shapefile format into a KML format. [http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html ogr2ogr] is used for this purpose, see [http:// Figure 1]. This is a command line utility used to convert and manipulate geospatial data from the [http://www.gdal.org/index.html Geospatial Data Abstraction Library]. The best way to get this utility in ready-to-use form is to download the latest [http://fwtools.maptools.org/ FWTools] kit.
