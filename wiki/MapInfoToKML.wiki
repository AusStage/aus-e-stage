#summary Notes on the procedure to convert MapInfo files to KML

== Introduction ==

In order to display ABS statistical data in our mapping service, we need create map overlays in a KML format using ABS geographic information first. What we have is [http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1259.0.30.001July%202010?OpenDocument Local Government Area ASGC Ed 2010 Digital Boundaries in MapInfo Interchange Format and ESRI Shapefile Format] from the ABS website. To construct an ABS overlay which can be used in Google Earth, we need to convert a MapInfo or ESRI Shapefile format into a KML format. [http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html ogr2ogr] is used for this purpose, see the following figure. This is a command line utility used to convert and manipulate geospatial data from the [http://www.gdal.org/index.html Geospatial Data Abstraction Library]. The best way to get this utility in ready-to-use form is to download the latest [http://fwtools.maptools.org/ FWTools] kit. [http://aus-e-stage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-assets/ogr2ogr.png]


== Construction Procedure ==

1.	Download and install [http://home.gdal.org/fwtools/FWTools247.exe FWtools 2.4.7 for Windows]. Follow the instructions on page [http://fwtools.maptools.org/windows-main.html]. Open the setfw.bat and openev.bat scripts in the FWTools install directory to setup the environment variables appropriately. To run ogr2ogr, select  Start -> All Programs menu -> FWTools 2.4.7 -> FWTools Shell. FWTools shell launches a DOS shell (cmd.exe) with the environment pre-initialized to use all the FWTools commands.
