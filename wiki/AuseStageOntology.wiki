#summary Summary of the Aus-e-Stage Ontology

= Introduction =

The Aus-e-Stage ontology is used by the RdfExport application to prepare the  NavigatingNetworksDataset. It is used to expedite the construction of the dataset for the NetworkService and should not be considered to be a definitive ontology. 

Work will be undertaken as part of the AusStage Phase 4 project on flattening the AusStage dataset and constructing appropriate ontologies. Once this work is complete the RdfExport and NetworkService should be updated to use these ontologies.

The Aus-e-Stage Ontology contains the following fields
