#summary How to access the Navigating Networks Data via the API

There are two ways to gain access to data held within the [NavigatingNetworksDataset Navigating Networks Dataset]. For the more advanced user a [NavigatingNetworksSparqlEndpoint SPARQL Endpoint] is available. This can be particularly useful for creating ad-hoc queries. 

The second way of retrieving data is by using the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface API] as outlined on this page.

= Lookup API =

The lookup API provide the functionality to lookup a defined dataset for a given contributor. The details of the API are as follows:

== Base URL ==

The base URL for the Lookup API is as follows:

http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/networks/lookup?

Combining this URL with the parameters outlines below retrieves data from the [NavigatingNetworksDataset Navigating Networks Dataset].

== Available Parameters ==

|| *Name* || *Possible Values* || *Optional* || *Default* ||
|| task   || key-contributors, system-property || No || ||
|| id     || Unique contributor id || No || ||
|| format || html xml json || Yes || html ||
|| sort   || count id name || Yes || count || 

=== task ===
The task parameter defines the type of lookup that is undertaken. For example key-contributors is a lookup that retrieves all of the contributors that a specified contributor has collaborated with

=== id ===
The id parameter defines the unique identifier of the contributor that is of interest.

_Note:_ if the task is a `system-property` lookup the following are valid ids

|| *id* || Lookup Value ||
|| 1    || The date and time that the RDF data store was created ||

=== format ===
The format parameter defines what format the resulting data with be presented in. 

 * html - a basic table format for direct inclusion in a HTML page
 * xml  - a list of objects serialised in a basic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML XML based format]
 * json - an array of objects serialised in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON JSON format]

=== sort ===
The way in which the data is sorted before it is returned

 * count - the number of collaborations (most frequent, to least frequent)
 * id    - by contributor id (ascending order)
 * name  - by name (alphabetical order by last name)

== Sample Output == 

The following is abbreviated sample outputs in response to the following base API calls:

=== html ===
