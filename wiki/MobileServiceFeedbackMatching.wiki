#summary Specification for the strategy to match feedback with performances

= Problem=

In trials so far a high percentage of feedback doesn't come back with the correct hashtags. At this stage (March 2010) most the feedback had come back via SMS  

eg when hash was #tusk2 user gave us  

  * TUSK 2  
  * Tusk2

This could be because user couldn't find the # on there phone.     

== Possible solutions ==

=== Improved user education and explanations === 
This could include approach such as having a tablet in the foyer that audience members could use.  

=== For twitter using @aus-stage replies   === 
The complexity with searching and matching happens with Twitter.  If user are able to reply to the @aus-stage then the match process will be easier.    

=== Search for partial matches  === 

We could thinking of the tag as having 3 criteria 

1) The word tusk 
2) The number 2 
3) The time it happen's  

When a perfect hasn't  been found then the system looks if 2 other criteria are meet.
