#summary Specification for the strategy to match feedback with performances

= Problem=

In trials so far a high percentage of feedback doesn't come back with the correct hashtags. At this stage (March 2010) most the feedback had come back via SMS  

eg when hash was #tusk2 user gave us  

  * TUSK 2  
  * Tusk2

This could be because user couldn't find the # on there phone.     

== Possible solutions ==

=== 1. Improved user education and explanation  === 
This could include approach such as having a tablet in the foyer that audience members could use.  

=== 2. For twitter using @aus-stage replies   === 
The complexity with searching and matching happens with Twitter. 

If user are able to reply to the @aus-stage then the match process could easier. If feedback was being sent back out via Twitter and people could follow @aus-stage and then a community might develop around the service. 

=== 3.  Search for partial matches  === 

We could thinking of the tag as having 3 criteria 

  # The word tusk 
  # The number 2 
  # The time it happen's  

When a perfect hasn't  been found then the system looks if 2 other criteria are meet.   The current system this would hard, maybe even impossible to achieve with the twitter gather.
