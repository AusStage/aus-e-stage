#summary Specification for the Strategy to Match Feedback with Performances

= Problem=

In trials to date a high percentage of feedback has not come back with a correct hashtag. At this stage (March 2011) most of the feedback has come back via SMS.  

eg when the hash was #tusk2 users gave us  

  * TUSK 2  
  * Tusk2

This could be because the user couldn't find the # on their phone.     

== Possible solutions ==

=== 1. Improved user education and explanation  === 
This could include the approach of having a tablet in the foyer that audience members could use.  

=== 2. For twitter using @aus-stage replies   === 
The complexity with searching and matching happens with Twitter. 

If user are able to reply to the @aus-stage then the match process could easier. If feedback was being sent back out via Twitter and people could follow @aus-stage then a community might develop around the service. 

=== 3.  Search for partial matches  === 
We could thinking of the tag as having 3 criteria: 

  # The word tusk 
  # The number 2 
  # The time it happens  

When a perfect match has not been found then the system looks to see whether two other criteria have been meet.   In the current system this would be hard, maybe even impossible to achieve with the twitter gatherer.
