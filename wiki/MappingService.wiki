#summary Information about the Mapping Service

<h1>!AusStage Mapping Service</h1>

The goal of the Mapping Service is to allow users to create maps that visualise event data. 

Currently the two maps that are available are:

 # [http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/mapping/organisations.jsp Maps by Organisation]
 # [http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/mapping/contributors.jsp Maps by Contributor]

A third map, based on an event title search, is planned. 

These maps allow users to focus on a specific geographic area, as well as a time period. Trajectory information is also available which provides some sense of where an organisation or contributor has been involved in events. 

More information on the service is available via the [http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/mapping AusStage Mapping Service] homepage.
