#summary TableBuilder application at the ABS Website

<h1>Access the ABS TableBuilder website</h1>

The TableBuilder website is the prefered method of exporting data from the [http://www.abs.gov.au Australian Bureau of Statistics] website as it is much faster, and provides a richer experience than the [http://www.abs.gov.au/census CDATA Online] website. 

Access to the TableBuilder website is restricted to those with a username and password. Users at Australian Universities are recommended to talk to their library in order to arrange access.

Other users can read about how to gain access at the [http://www.abs.gov.au/TableBuilder TableBuilder] website.
