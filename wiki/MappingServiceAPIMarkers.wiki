#summary Mapping Service API - Marker Data

<h1>Marker Data</h1>

Components of the MappingService are exposed as an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface API]. The intention of the API is to make it easier for developers to customise their own front end interfaces and to split the work equitably amongst the software engineers working on the Aus-e-Stage project. 

The Marker Data API exposes methods and data elements that can be used to construct a map on a web page. 

_Note: During development of the service revisions the API will use a temporary URL which will be changed once the service revisions are complete.

== Base URL ==

http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/mapping2/markers?

Combining the base URL with the parameters outlined below constructs a call to the API.

== Parameters ==

|| *Name*   || *Possible Values* || *Optional* || *Default* ||
|| type     || state, suburb, venue, organisation, contributor || No || ||
|| id       || Unique contributor or organisation id || No || ||
|| callback || function name to use for a JSONP request || Yes || || 

_Note: _ The id parameter is optional when used with the state task

=== type ===

The type parameter specifies whether the call to the API is for data on venues at the state, suburb or specific venue. As well as data on venues associated with an organisation or a contributor

=== id ===

If the task type is set to state this parameter, if present, is ignored.

If the task type is set to suburb the parameter is is expected to be encoded as follows:

state-id_suburb-name

For example:

1_Adelaide

For all other task types the id parameter is a comma separated list of unique identifiers.

_Note: It is not possible to mix types of ids in a single call to the API. Therefore if the type is set to venue only venue ids must be specified, conversely if the type is set to contributor only contributor ids must be specified._
