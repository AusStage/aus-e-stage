<h1>Mapping Service API</h1>

The Mapping Service exposes an [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) for the retrieval of data related to building a map on a web page and the export of data in the [KML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) format.

Data exported in the KML format can be used with a wide variety of [GIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) based applications including the popular [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/) application.

_Note: The Mapping Service is undergoing extensive revisions and as such only the updated API will be listed here as it is completed._

Details of the API are in the following pages:

  * [Marker Data API](MappingServiceAPIMarkers.md) - retrieve data used to build markers
  * [Search API](MappingServiceAPISearch.md) - search for organisations / contributors etc.
  * [Lookup API](MappingServiceAPILookup.md) - lookup various data elements in the system
  * [Events API](MappingServiceAPIEvents.md) - lookup details of events at Venues to use in populating infoWindows
