# Mobile Service #

The mobile service will be used to solicit feedback in real time from audience members who are attending, or have just attended, a performance.

The feedback will be solicited using a combination of [SMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and will be analysed using a variety of qualitative techniques.

More information about the service will be posted here and to the [Aus-e-Stage project website](http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/) as development progresses.
