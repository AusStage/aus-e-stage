AusStage provides an accessible research facility for investigating live performance in Australia. It was built by a consortium of universities and industry partners with funding from the [Australian Research Council](http://www.arc.gov.au/).

Australia stages some of the most ambitious, innovative and socially significant live events. Live interaction at communal events is essential to the cultural life of the nation. Innovative live performances project images of Australian culture to audiences here and overseas.

AusStage records information on live performance in Australia, as a wealth-producing creative industry, a generator of social capital and an indicator of the nation's cultural vitality.
