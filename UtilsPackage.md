# AusStage Utilities Package #

The AusStage Utilities Package contains classes that are useful in undertaking repetitive tasks and provides a number of utility based functions.

_Note: Some applications / servlets may use their own independent implementations of these methods / classes as they were developed **before** the utilities package. Where this is the case work should be undertaken to replace the independent functionality with that available in this package._

## Documentation ##

Details of the classes and methods available is contained in the standard Javadoc files available via the [source repository](http://aus-e-stage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/utils-lib/docs/api/index.html).
