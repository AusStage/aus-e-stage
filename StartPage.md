# Introduction #

The [Aus-e-Stage](http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/) project is a [NeAT funded](https://www.pfc.org.au/bin/view/Main/NeAT) project that is working on developing services that extend the capabilities of the existing text-based search-and-retrieval [AusStage](http://www.ausstage.edu.au) website.

[AusStage](http://www.ausstage.edu.au)  fulfils a national need for public access to reliable information on the full spectrum of live performance in Australia, delivering a data set of national significance to research, post graduate students, policy makers in government and industry practitioners; there is no other comparable database in existence.


# Services #

The three main services currently under development are:

  * [Mapping Service](MappingService.md) - Mapping Events and Venues
  * [Mobile Service](MobileService.md) - Researching Audience Participation
  * [Network Service](NetworkService.md) - Navigating Artistic Networks

# Purpose of this Wiki #

The purpose of this Wiki is to manage documentation specifically related to the development activities that are building the above services.
