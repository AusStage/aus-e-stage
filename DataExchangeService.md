<h1>Data Exchange Service</h1>

The Data Exchange Service is designed to allow users to retrieve in real time data from the [AusStage](http://www.ausstage.edu.au) database. The data can be retrieved in the following formats:

  1. html - as an unordered list
  1. json - data formatted as a series of objects encoded using the [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) syntax
  1. xml  - as a series of elements in an [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) file
  1. rss  - as a standard [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed

An optional parameter can also be used which will cause the data to be wrapped in a [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) function to make it easier to integrate with existing websites.

More information about the service is available on the [AusStage Data Exchange Service](http://beta.ausstage.edu.au/exchange/) homepage
